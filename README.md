## My process

### üí° Built with

Our Role-Playing Game (RPG) project is built with the following technologies and tools:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for creating the structure and content of the game interface.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling the HTML elements, including layout, colors, fonts, and visual effects.
- JavaScript is used for implementing interactivity, game logic, event handling, and dynamic behavior of the game.

### üß† What I learned

Throughout the development of this Role-Playing Game (RPG) project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I will acquire valuable skills and knowledge in the following areas:

- Frontend Development: Gain proficiency in building interactive and visually appealing user interfaces using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
- Game Design Principles: Understand fundamental game design principles such as character creation, world-building, quest design, combat mechanics, and player progression.
- DOM Manipulation: Learn how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to dynamically update the game interface, handle user input, and create interactive elements.
- Event Handling: Master event handling techniques in JavaScript to respond to user actions, trigger game events, and implement gameplay mechanics such as combat, quest completion, and character progression.
- Responsive Design: Explore responsive design principles in CSS to ensure the game interface adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal user experience across platforms.
- Performance Optimization: Learn strategies to optimize the performance of your game, including minimizing DOM manipulation, optimizing CSS and JavaScript code, and reducing loading times for assets.
- Debugging and Troubleshooting: Develop debugging skills to identify and resolve issues in your code, including syntax errors, logic errors, and runtime errors, using browser developer tools and debugging techniques.

```javascript
  const monsterHealthText = document.querySelector("#monsterHealth");

  { name: "dagger", power: 30 },
  { name: "claw hammer", power: 50 },
  { name: "sword", power: 100 },
];
```
```javascript
const locations = [
  {
    name: "town square",
    "button text": ["Go to store", "Go to cave", "Fight dragon"],

      "Go to town square",
    ],
    "button functions": [buyHealth, buyWeapon, goTown],
    text: "You enter the store.",
  }
];
